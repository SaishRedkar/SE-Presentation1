#<center>**What is Black box testing?**</center>
<br>
##<u>Definition:</u>
**Black box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal 
structures or workings. Knowledge of the internal logic of the system being tested is not required.**
<br><br>
The tester has a set of input values and a set of expected output values and is unaware of how the inputs are transformed into those outputs. Since the tester is not able to view what happens on the inside, hence the name blackbox.

#<center>**Why is it necessary?**</center>

<ul>
	<li>Black box testing helps in verification of the overall functionality of the system.</li><br>

	<li>Black-box testing is most commonly used type of testing in traditional organizations that have testers as a separate department, especially when they are not proficient in coding and have difficulties to understand the code. It provides external perspective of the software under test.</li><br>
	<li>Since the requirements are an important part of this, it helps in identifying any uncertain, incomplete or inconsistent requirements.</li><br>
	<li>Black box testing handles explicit or stated requirements and implied requirements. Eg: Page numbers, dates, headers, footers etc all improve readibility of the document for the customer.</li><br>
</ul>

#<center>**Advantages of Black box testing**</center>
<ul>
	<li>The testing team works independently of the design time. This removes all bias while testing the particular product.</li><br>
	<li>In other testing techniques, the tester must require some technical knowledge or some prgogramming language. Since black box testing does not require any knowledge of the interntal logic, a non-technical person could also perform testing.</li><br>
	<li>It helps in identifying cases where requirements are inconsistent or missing or ambigious.</li><br>
	<li>The testing is performed with the end-user's perspective.</li><br>
	<li>Once the functional specifications are complete, the test cases can be desgined immediately.</li><br>
</ul>

#<center>**Disdvantages of Black box testing**</center>
<ul>
	<li>The reason for failures is not found.</li><br>
	<li>Not all properties of the software system can be tested efficiently. This may lead to a number of paths not being tested.</li><br>
	<li>Certain segments of the code may be more complex and require more testing. This becomes difficult using black box testing.</li><br>
	<li>Since the testing team works independently some tests which have already been covered, may get repeated.</li><br>
	<li>Without having clear specifications, designing test cases becomes difficult.</li><br>
</ul>
